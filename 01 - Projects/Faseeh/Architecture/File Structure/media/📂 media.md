# `library/{uuid}` Directory Overview

> [!Note] Description
> Represents the dedicated container folder for a **single imported media item**. The folder name `{media_object_uuid}` is the unique ID corresponding to the item's record in the `MediaObject` table in the database. It aggregates all files related to this specific item.
