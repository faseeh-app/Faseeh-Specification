# Renderer Entry Point / Lifecycle Overview

> [!Note] Description
> This is the starting point for all execution within a Faseeh Renderer process (window). Its primary responsibilities are to initialize the application environment, instantiate and wire up all core Renderer services using Dependency Injection, set up communication channels (IPC listeners, Preload API access), load and initialize the UI framework (Vue.js), and manage the graceful shutdown sequence for Renderer components when the window closes.

## Key Notes

> [!Summary]+ Key Responsibilities:
>
> - <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Environment Initialization:</span> Performs essential setup, potentially including global configurations or polyfills.
>
> ---
>
> - <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Shared Resource Creation:</span>
>   - Instantiates the shared **[[Event Emitter Wrapper]]** instances (e.g., `workspaceEvents`, `vaultEvents`, `pluginEvents`).
>   - Obtains and prepares the reference to the API exposed by the Preload script (e.g., `window.faseehStorageAPI`).
>
> ---
>
> - <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Core Service Instantiation & Dependency Injection:</span>
>   - Creates instances of all core **Renderer process** services ([[Plugin Manager]], [[Content Adapter Registry]], [[Manual Import Service]], [[Text Tokenizer Registery|Tokenizer Registry]], [[OCR Registry Service|OCR Registry]], [[Subtitle Engine Registry]], [[Language Detector]], [[Event Translator]]).
>   - **Crucially manages Dependency Injection:** Passes required dependencies (like shared event emitters, storage API facade, or other service instances) to each service via their constructors or an initialization method. **Ensures correct instantiation order** if services have direct dependencies on each other.
>
> ---
>
> - <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Event Translator Setup:</span> Ensures the [[Event Translator]] (or equivalent logic) is initialized and starts listening for messages sent _from_ the Main process (e.g., `'webclip-import-data-received'`).
>
> ---
>
> - <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Plugin System Initialization:</span> Initializes the [[Plugin Manager]] service, which then begins the process of discovering and loading enabled plugins. The Plugin Manager uses the shared resources (emitters, storage API) provided during its instantiation to construct the [[FaseehApp]] API object for plugins.
>
> ---
>
> - <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">UI Framework Initialization:</span> Initializes and mounts the main Vue.js application, providing it with necessary access to core services, state management stores, or the shared context required for UI components to function and interact with the backend.
>
> ---
>
> - <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Graceful Shutdown Coordination:</span> Listens for window closing events (e.g., `window.onbeforeunload`). Before the window closes, it **must trigger the `destroy()` or `cleanupAll()` methods** on all core services that require explicit cleanup (especially those using [[Listener Tracker]] or holding persistent connections/resources) to unregister listeners and release resources.
>
> ---
>
> - <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Global Error Handling (Optional):</span> May set up global JavaScript error handlers (`window.onerror`, `window.onunhandledrejection`) specific to the Renderer process for logging or reporting.

> [!Example]- Workflow (Application Startup in Renderer):
>
> 1.  **Script Execution:** Electron loads the Renderer's main HTML and executes this entry point script (`renderer.ts`/`main.ts`).
>
> ---
>
> 2.  **Create Shared Resources:** Instantiate `workspaceEvents`, `vaultEvents`, etc. Get reference to `window.faseehStorageAPI`.
>
> ---
>
> 3.  **Instantiate Services (DI):** Create instances of all core Renderer services in the correct dependency order, injecting shared emitters, storage API facade, and other required service instances into constructors.
>
> ---
>
> 4.  **Setup IPC Bridge:** Ensure the [[Event Translator]] starts listening for messages from the Main process.
>
> ---
>
> 5.  **Initialize Plugin Manager:** Call an initialization method on the [[Plugin Manager]] instance. It starts scanning for plugins, reading manifests, resolving dependencies, and asynchronously loading enabled plugins (plugins receive the [[FaseehApp]] object constructed by the Plugin Manager using the shared resources).
>
> ---
>
> 6.  **Mount UI:** Initialize the Vue app (`createApp(App).mount('#app')`), potentially providing global state or service access to the Vue instance.
>
> ---
>
> 7.  **Ready:** The application UI is visible and interactive. Plugins continue loading in the background if asynchronous.

> [!Example]- Workflow (Window Closing): 
> 1. **Close Event:** User attempts to close the window, or the Main process initiates shutdown. The `window.onbeforeunload` event (or similar mechanism) is triggered.
>
> ---
>
> 2.  **Trigger Service Cleanup:** The shutdown handler in the entry point script iterates through core services that need cleanup (those with a `destroy()` method, often tracked during setup).
>
> ---
>
> 3. **Execute Cleanup:** Calls `service.destroy()` on each relevant service (e.g., [[Content Adapter Registry]], [[Plugin Manager]], [[Event Translator]]). These `destroy` methods call `listenerTracker.cleanupAll()` and unregister specific IPC listeners. The [[Plugin Manager]]'s shutdown logic also unloads all active plugins (calling `onunload` and `_cleanupListeners`).
>
> ---
>
> 4. **Allow Closure:** Once cleanup promises resolve (if async), the `onbeforeunload` handler allows the window closing process to complete.

> [!Tip] Importance:
> This entry point is the "conductor" for the Renderer process. Its setup dictates how services are connected and communicate. Its shutdown logic is critical for preventing resource leaks (especially listeners) when the window closes. Using a simple Dependency Injection pattern here (manual or via a lightweight library) is highly recommended for managing service relationships.
